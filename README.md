# ETL Systems RF Matrix Companion Module

This is a [Bitfocus Companion](https://bitfocus.io/companion) module for controlling ETL Systems RF Matrix devices, originally developed for the **Victor** series.

## Features

- TCP/IP control using ETL's published protocol
- Actions for switching inputs and outputs
- Feedback for current routing
- Configurable connection parameters

## Compatibility

Although this module is built and tested for the ETL Victor RF Matrix, it **should** work with most ETL RF matrix models using the same protocol.  
I have not tested it with other ETL models. If you try it on a different model:

- Please report whether it works
- Share any errors or unexpected behavior

This information will help make the module more robust for everyone.

## Installation

1. Install Bitfocus Companion
2. Add this module via the modules interface
3. Configure the IP address and port
4. Add actions to your buttons
